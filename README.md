### About  ###

Craftastic is a wiki-like site where users can post crafting recipes for games. They can create pages for specific games, then add pages for items within those games, with lists of items used in the crafting recipe. Other fields include how many of each item is used, whether time is involved in the craft, how many of the item the recipe yields, a picture of the item, and the version of the game where the recipe is functional. Each recipe also contains a revision history, so users can revert back to previous posts if a crafting recipe has changed back to a previous recipe.
